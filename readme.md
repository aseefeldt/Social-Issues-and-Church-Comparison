## Summary 
The christian Church in the United States has a large presense in every state.  This presesnse can be used for great humanitarian support.  Unfortanatly, this is not always the case.  Many Church leaders feel overwhelmed when helping the needy.  

The point of this project is to break down the numbers, by state, so that church leaders realize it is doable to help the homless and needy and that even a small chuch can do their part to help their neighbors.
